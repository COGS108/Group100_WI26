    "**How do variables such as game genre, price, average length of playtime, and achievement number influence how Steam games are rated on the Steam shop globally since the platform's launch in 2003? Can these variables be used to predict how a Steam game might be rated?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All the variables are attributes of games listed in the Steam storefront page for a game.\n",
    "Steam game genre refers to the available platforms and number of players it is targeting, price refers to the amount of currency in dollars required to purchase (including free games), average length of playtime refers to the average amount of time in hours it takes a player to reach an ending of the game for the first time, and achievement number refers to how many achievements can be attained by meeting in-game requirements for a game.\n",
    "We are restricting our population to games on Steam, and thus only reviewing ratings left on the Steam platform. \n",
    "We are interested in sampling across a time period of 26 years and investigating whether there are any significant patterns in the aforementioned variables. \n"

    "Steam, a digital distribution service, lets its users buy video games from its digital store with a catalog of thousands of publishers, as well as install into and play video games from the users’ own digital library.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Important attributes of the games, such as their genre, price, number of game achievements are displayed on their store pages, allowing interested players to quickly get a feel for the game they may want to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews from players who purchased the game are also displayed, where each review provides a Positive or Negative rating, as well as how long the player played the game for.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "An overall game rating thus presents the percentage proportion of positive reviews in contrast to negative reviews, as well as the number of reviews submitted (eg. 80% positive reviews out of a 100 total reviews would seem more attractive than 80% positive reviews out of 10 total reviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there could potentially be certain factors such as specific genres that tend to get rated more highly by players. Price could also impact player ratings by making people judge more expensive games more harshly. We were therefore interested in finding if there is any significant influence of the displayed variables on how a game is rated.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking through previous group projects as resources, we found several that several projects previously also examined how the rating of something is influenced by multiple factors, such as how _Game of Thrones_ episode ratings, or restaurant Michelin Stars ratings.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Game of Thrones project classified episode features by order of rating impact through a Random Forest method and XGBoost Classifier Model, finding Character Presence and Episode Sentiment as the two most impactful features through both methods. The Michelin Stars project analyzed restaurant names and cuisines through Support Vector Regression and Linear Regression on price, attempting to predict star ratings through these factors, and found no particular directional relationship of these factors with Michelin Star Rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both projects provide valuable insight as to how our group could approach our question. We can find and specify variables most relevant to game rating and test specific algorithms to see if they could predict rating off these factors, since our project will use similar parameters due to Steam games also being a form of consumed entertainment. However, unlike previous projects that focused on how to give recommendations based on previous consumer activity, we aim to use concrete statistics such as cost and average play time to analyze the factors behind what gives a Steam game its ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several publicly available repositories on github showing projects using steam games datasets for the purposes of building a recommendation system, such as one by Christian Craft that went into data analysis with the variables of reviews, popular tags, game details, and genres to use the K-Nearest Neighbors and Collaborative Filtering methods to determine games similar to an inputted game.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showed an example of how predictive machine learning could project similarities between given games, while our project would focus more on analyzing the existing potential impacts on game rating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these previous projects inspired us on the topic and methods related to analyzing data on ratings, and gave us a sense of what direction our project should head towards. We aim to take our investigation one step further and address the unexplored potential in whether the way players evaluate Steam games is impacted by objective properties of the games such as price and play time rather than subjective properties such as writing and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, game ratings are a reflection of the quality and enjoyment a game delivers to its consumers. Our topic of finding variable relationships to game ratings is significant as it could potentially give game creators a reference on what they should focus on during development to get the best reception possible from players. For consumers, this will increase their engagement and improve their perception of the game, which could therefore increase consumer rates of these games. For developers, increased consumption can result in increased sales of these games, allowing them to generate more revenue for their company and access a more universal player base. \n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that there is a strong positive correlation between variables such as genre, game length, and achievement count with the overall rating of a game, while cost would have a negative correlation. For instance, if a game had a higher cost, that may cause players to have higher expectations of a game's quality, with the high cost of certain games coming from game complexities and design, studio reputation, and development time. Additionally, we predict that game genre has a high influence on the rating of a game, with more popular genres such as FPS games generally receiving higher ratings than puzzle or gacha games due to some players feeling frustrated over genre-specific mechanics such as overly difficult/unintuitive puzzles or unforgiving gacha rates.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> Our project will be focusing on data on video games, not human subjects. This data is publicly available and displayed by developers and publishers on Steam for the purpose of informing interested individuals about their games.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will check for and acknowledge any unusual patterns in the data for any specific games seemingly being over or under represented.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> Variables of interest we will collect information on are information such as genre and rating and other descriptive measurements of games, which pertain to the games themselves and not any individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> The variables we are collecting information on with regards to video games are not based on protect human group status.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> The data we are working with is publicly available and accessible to any interested user through Kaggle. However, the data in its edited form for the project will only be directly available through our group's local machines.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> No personal or sensitive information of individuals is being collected or analyzed. However, we will be open to information takedown requests through our contacts such as by email.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will likely retain the data until the members of this group graduate or longer, but we will be open to information takedown if needed. However, the datasets we will use are all still publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will be open to discussing and critiquing our analysis and findings with any interested stakeholders. We have looked through previous projects and work done in the area of Steam game data analysis to consider our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We acknowledge that reviews collected from Steam will likely not generalize to a broader population, so we are designating our population of interest as Steam users specifically. We will examine our data and the source of our dataset to consider any biased processes that could have impacted data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will design our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports to be as legible and reflective of the underlying data as possible. We will not tamper with our analyses to present our ideal findings over the facts.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> No data with PII will be used in the analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will document each step of our analysis clearly for any future reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> The variables involved in the model are objective metrics of video games such as genre and achievement number that are not collected through discriminatory methods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will test our model's results for fairness across the various aspects of video games.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We are looking into the most relevant variables out of the datasets available to us that can effectively describe video games and can potentially affect how people rate games. So far, game genre, playtime, game price, game achievement numbers seem like a solid start. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will explain as best we can why our models will behave in specific ways given the data available to it and the model's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will acknowledge the limitations we have with regards to how our models will act on limited data collected on Steam games as clearly as we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We can examine how generally applicable our model of predicting Steam game ratings is on data of new games released this year to see the consistency of its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> If anyone is harmed by our model, we will consider what aspect of the model could have been used to harm them and how we can clarify the intended use for our model instead. For example, if consumers were to actually base their purchasing decisions off of the model predicting game ratings and thereby denying new games a playerbase, we would clarify that the model results are intended to be predictive and reflect data collected on previously released games and cannot always generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We will be open to taking down our model from public access if it is misused.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> Unintended uses and/or abuses could be game publishers' playerbases being significantly impacted due to unfavorable predicted game ratings from the model, or model results of predicted ratings being used to undeservedly slander or praise particular games. We will be open to being contacted for any concerns over how our model is being used."
