    "When looking through previous group projects as resources, we found several that several projects previously also examined how the rating of something is influenced by multiple factors, such as how _Game of Thrones_ episode ratings were affected by different variables, or if any factors were associated with how a restaurant could receive Michelin Stars.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Game of Thrones project classified episode features by order of rating impact through a Random Forest method and XGBoost Classifier Model, finding Character Presence and Episode Sentiment as the two most impactful features through both methods. The Michelin Stars project analyzed restaurant names and cuisines through Support Vector Regression and Linear Regression on price, attempting to predict star ratings through these factors, and found no particular directional relationship of these factors with Michelin Star Rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both show how our group could approach our question by finding and specifying variables most relevant to game rating and testing specific algorithms to see if they could predict rating off these factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several publicly available repositories on github showing projects using steam games datasets for the purposes of building a recommendation system, such as one by Christian Craft that went into data analysis with the variables of reviews, popular tags, game details, and genres to use the K-Nearest Neighbors and Collaborative Filtering methods to determine games similar to an inputted game.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5)\n",

Ideally, we would have on dataset that includes all the variables we outlined in the research question: game genre, price, average playtime length, and achievement number.

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "> Our project will be focusing on data on video games, not human subjects. This data is publicly available and displayed by developers and publishers on Steam for the purpose of informing interested individuals about their games.\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> We will check for and acknowledge any unusual patterns in the data for any specific games seemingly being over or under represented.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "> Variables of interest we will collect information on are information such as genre and rating and other descriptive measurements of games, which pertain to the games themselves and not any individuals. \n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "> The variables we are collecting information on with regards to video games are not based on protect human group status. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> The data we are working with is publicly available and accessible to any interested user through Kaggle. However, the data in its edited form for the project will only be directly available through our group's local machines.\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "> No personal or sensitive information of individuals is being collected or analyzed. However, we will be open to information takedown requests through our contacts such as by email.\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "> We will likely retain the data until the members of this group graduate or longer, but we will be open to information takedown if needed. However, the datasets we will use are all still publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> We will be open to discussing and critiquing our analysis and findings with any interested stakeholders. We have looked through previous projects and work done in the area of Steam game data analysis to consider our research question. \n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We acknowledge that reviews collected from Steam will likely not generalize to a broader population, so we are designating our population of interest as Steam users specifically. We will examine our data and the source of our dataset to consider any biased processes that could have impacted data collection.\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> We will design our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports to be as legible and reflective of the underlying data as possible. We will not tamper with our analyses to present our ideal findings over the facts.\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> No data with PII will be used in the analyses. \n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> We will document each step of our analysis clearly for any future reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> The variables involved in the model are objective metrics of video games such as genre and achievement number that are not collected through discriminatory methods.\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> We will test our model's results for fairness across the various aspects of video games. \n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We are looking into \n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> We will explain as best we can why our models will behave in specific ways given the data available to it and the model's behavior.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will acknowledge the limitations we have with regards to how our models will act on limited data collected on Steam games as clearly as we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> We can examine how generally applicable our model of predicting Steam game ratings is on data of new games released this year to see the consistency of its performance.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> If anyone is harmed by our model, we will consider what aspect of the model could have been used to harm them and how we can clarify the intended use for our model instead. For example, if consumers were to actually base their purchasing decisions off of the model predicting game ratings and thereby denying new games a playerbase, we would clarify that the model results are intended to be predictive and reflect data collected on previously released games and cannot always generalize well.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> We will be open to taking down our model from public access if it is misused.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> Unintended uses and/or abuses could be game publishers' playerbases being significantly impacted due to unfavorable predicted game ratings from the model, or model results of predicted ratings being used to undeservedly slander or praise particular games. We will be open to being contacted for any concerns over how our model is being used."
